Understanding intimate partner abuse (IPA) in a specific country requires a nuanced approach that considers cultural, 
legal, social, and economic factors. Here are some key questions we asked to gain a comprehensive understanding.

## Legal and policy framework

**Enforcement & accountability**

* Are laws against IPA consistently enforced, or do biases (e.g., gender, class, ethnicity) affect implementation?
* What penalties exist for perpetrators, and are they effectively applied?

**Legal protections for survivors**

* Can survivors easily obtain protection orders, and are they enforced?
* Are there legal aid services for survivors navigating the justice system?

**Marriage & divorce laws**

* Does the legal system make it difficult for survivors to divorce abusive partners?
* Are there "reconciliation" mandates that force survivors back into abusive relationships?

## Cultural and social norms

**Masculinity & power dynamics**

* How is male dominance reinforced in relationships, and how does this contribute to IPA?
* Are there cultural narratives that blame victims (e.g., "she provoked him")?

**Religion & tradition**

* Do religious leaders condemn or justify IPA?
* Are there customary dispute-resolution practices that pressure survivors to stay silent?

**Stigma & shame**

* Is reporting IPA seen as "betraying the family"?
* Do survivors face backlash (e.g., ostracization, honor-based violence) for speaking out?

## Support systems and services

**Accessibility & quality**

* Are shelters, counseling, and legal aid concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural survivors underserved?
* Do service providers receive trauma-informed training?

**Marginalized groups**

* Are LGBTQ+ survivors discriminated against when seeking help?
* Do migrant survivors fear deportation if they report abuse?

## Economic factors

**Financial control as abuse**

* How common is economic abuse (e.g., withholding money, sabotaging employment)?

**Survivor economic independence**

* Are there microloan or job-training programs for survivors?
* Do banks offer financial protections (e.g., separating shared accounts)?

## Data and reporting

**Underreporting causes**

* Do police discourage survivors from filing reports?
* Are medical professionals trained to identify and document IPA?

**Alternative data sources**

* Are there NGO or academic studies that provide more accurate prevalence rates than official statistics?

## Prevention and awareness

**Early education**

* Do schools teach consent and gender equality?
* Are boys and young men included in anti-violence programs?

**Media representation**

* Do TV shows, films, or news outlets trivialize IPA or perpetuate victim-blaming?

## Intersectional considerations

**Disability & IPA**

* Are disabled survivors more vulnerable due to dependency on caregivers?

**Ethnic & indigenous communities**

* Do language barriers or distrust of authorities prevent reporting?

## Technological and emerging issues

**Digital abuse**

* Are there laws against non-consensual intimate image sharing (revenge porn)?
* Do social media platforms cooperate in removing abusive content?

**Surveillance & control**

* Is spyware or GPS tracking used by abusers to monitor partners?

## International and NGO influence

**Grassroots vs. top-down efforts**

* Are international organizations (UN, WHO, NGOs) involved in addressing IPA in this country?
* Are international programs culturally adapted, or do they impose foreign frameworks?
* Are local womenâ€™s rights groups adequately funded?

**Policy vs. practice**

* Does the government publicly support IPA reforms while failing to allocate resources?
* What gaps exist between policy and implementation?

## Survivor-centered approaches

* Are survivors involved in policy-making or program design?
* What alternative justice mechanisms exist (e.g., restorative justice, community-based interventions)?
* Crisis triggers: Does IPA increase during economic crises, conflicts, or pandemics?
* Men as survivors: How are male IPA survivors perceived, and are services available to them?
* How do authorities respond to digital forms of abuse?

## Disclaimer

This framework is designed to prompt critical inquiry into intimate partner violence across contexts. While informed 
by evidence-based research, it is not exhaustive and may require adaptation to local realities. Intimate partner 
violence manifests differently based on cultural, legal, and socioeconomic factors, and these questions should be 
supplemented with:

* Rigorous mixed-methods research (e.g., surveys, interviews)
* Engagement with local experts (social workers, advocates)
* Intersectional analysis of overlapping vulnerabilities (race, class, disability).

This tool does not replace professional evaluation or clinical assessment.
