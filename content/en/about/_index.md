<h1>About PowerOn</h1>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Power On is a collective initiative to help people reclaim control over their digital lives — especially when that control has been stripped away by abuse, surveillance, or coercion.

It began as a collaboration between writer and activist [Meltem Arikan](https://www.meltemarikan.com/), systems 
tinkerer [TyMyrddin](https://tymyrddin.dev), and a group of privacy and security facilitators working with survivors 
of intimate partner violence. The project is supported by [/ut7](https://ut7.fr/), a Paris-based cooperative (SCOP) 
founded in 2007, specializing in agile software development, philosophical research, and digital/philosophical 
learning spaces.

**PowerOn is a growing toolkit for taking back tech.**

We create hands-on workshops, simple guides, and DIY tools anyone can use to clean or set up a safer device, build a tech lab in a shelter, or run peer-led trainings in their own language and context. Whether it’s spotting digital traps, blocking stalkerware, or helping someone secure their phone without making things worse — PowerOn is built to support that work.

We don’t assume trust in platforms. We don’t expect money, tech skills, or access to experts. And we don’t treat safety like a checklist.

**Because survivors deserve tools that work for them — not against them.**

Start where it makes sense. Translate it. Break it. Make it yours.

  Power On is built with stubborn optimism, dry humour, and a refusal to give up the digital space.
