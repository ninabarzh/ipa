If you’re facing tech-based abuse, you don’t always get to prove it in the moment.  
But evidence—if collected carefully—can become power. It can help with legal protection, housing, support services, or simply *being believed*.

This guide walks you through calm, low-risk ways to gather and store digital evidence.

## Screenshots: what to include, when to export, how to timestamp

Good screenshots tell a story. Capture them *in context*:

- Include:
  - Time and date (e.g. top bar of the phone or computer)
  - The sender or source (who did what)
  - The action or message in full—*no cropping*

- Best times to screenshot:
  - When messages are edited or deleted
  - When login or security alerts come in
  - When app behaviour suddenly changes (e.g. GPS active, camera on)

- Timestamping tips:
  - Take a second screenshot showing your system clock
  - Or email the image to yourself immediately (adds a reliable date)

## Metadata logs, browser history, and app data

The digital trail you don’t see—until you need it.

- Browser history:
  - Shows access patterns, visited links, login attempts
  - Can prove if someone was impersonating you or tampering remotely

- Cloud/app logs:
  - Google: https://myactivity.google.com  
  - Apple: iCloud logs, device access history  
  - Dropbox/OneDrive: file open/edit logs

- Login logs:
  - Email accounts often show last IP used, device type, location
  - Screenshot and export logs *before* changing passwords

- Calendar/app activity:
  - Note added or deleted events, recurring reminders, etc.

Save logs as PDF, CSV, or HTML when possible. Emailing yourself the files helps preserve the timestamp trail.

## Voice recordings and journaling patterns

Sometimes the abuse isn’t digital—it just *uses* tech. Your own words can become a reliable record.

- Voice memos:
  - Record your observations after something happens (“Today I found…”)
  - Can be useful if writing feels too formal or slow

- Journaling:
  - Paper, notes app, or secure journaling tool  
  - Focus on what happened, how it made you feel, and what was unusual

- Patterns matter:
  - “He reset the router again after I changed the passwords”  
  - “She said she knew I was at the pharmacy, though I hadn’t told her”

Don’t worry about making it sound official. Just make it real.

## Third-party verification (email headers, IP addresses, others)

If someone claims you did something online—you’ll want more than your word.

- Email headers:
  - Show *who* really sent a message, from *where*, using *what service*
  - Forward the email (as attachment) to a tech-savvy ally or legal advisor

- IP logs:
  - Google, Microsoft, and many apps show recent login IPs
  - Match IP addresses to times you know *you* were online

- Witnessing tools:
  - Services like [Tella](https://tella-app.org/) (open-source) offer ways to create secure, tamper-evident documentation
  - Cloud backup with timestamps from trusted providers (ProtonDrive, Google Drive with 2FA) also helps

## Tools that don’t shout “surveillance!”

Some evidence tools can escalate the situation if found. These don’t:

- Simple tools:
  - Phone’s built-in screenshot or screen recorder
  - Encrypted notes apps (e.g. Standard Notes, Joplin)
  - USB stick hidden in a safe place

- Safer journaling apps:
  - [Tella](https://tella-app.org/) (discreet, designed for documenting abuse and human rights violations)
  - Encrypted note apps (e.g., Standard Notes, Joplin), or a simple offline notebook

- Discreet cloud backup:
  - Set up an email alias (e.g. yourname+docs@proton.me)
  - Auto-forward logs or screenshots via a private browser tab

Avoid using shared devices to store sensitive evidence unless you *know* it’s safe.

## A word on this section

You don’t need to prove everything, all at once. You just need to start creating a record—quietly, calmly, and in a way that helps *you*.
