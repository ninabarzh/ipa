description: "A cost guesstimate for running the Tech safety for survivors choose-your-own-pace-day. This is designed for up to 20 participants at a shelter or community venue, with both a low-budget version (DIY/volunteer-powered) and a realistic full-cost version that respects people’s time and pays facilitators fairly."

## Possible cost savers

* Max impact, minimal budget: This workshop works well even with DIY, volunteers, and second-hand tech—the atmosphere and approach matter more than the gear.
* If you plan to run more than one, the startup costs (e.g., tech kit, signage) drop significantly per workshop.
* A donated venue and local food sponsors (e.g., bakery, co-op) can cut some costs.
