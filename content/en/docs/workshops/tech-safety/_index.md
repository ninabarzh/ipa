description: "This is not a tech training. It’s a friendly, choose-your-own-pace day where survivors can explore tools, learn skills, and restore digital confidence—on their own terms. Whether someone wants to scan their device, ask one quiet question, or draw a comic about their least favourite app—this day holds space for it all."

## Food & comfort

* Drinks, snacks, and soft seating always available
* Lunch: relaxed buffet, dietary needs respected
* Low-stimulation rest areas available for downtime
* Music optional (always off near the quiet stations)

## Zones & stations

Stations are open all day unless noted otherwise. Survivors are invited to visit them in *any* order, stay as long as they like, or skip entirely.

### Phone & laptop check – *"My phone’s acting weird"*

* Use a demo device or your own
* With Pirogue (if shelter has one, or we bring one)
* Scan, review results, talk it through
* No scare tactics—just calm explanation

Takeaway: A printed or emailed scan report, a follow-up plan (optional)

### App permissions detective – *"Why does this app need my camera?"*

* Hands-on exercise
* Learn how to find sneaky permissions
* Guess which app is the worst snooper

Mini-competition: “Biggest privacy violator” earns a joke certificate

### Roleplay theatre – *"Is this message real?"*

Live or printed scenarios you can join or observe:

* “Nice guy who just needs your GPS password”
* “That email isn’t from Apple, is it?”
* “Oops—someone added a device to your account”

Activity: Spot the trap, rewrite the ending

### Password challenge tent – *"Build one I can actually remember"*

* Try common password guesses
* Make passphrases that work (e.g. “bread-squirrel-pizza-22”)
* Play with fake accounts to test strength

Win: A zine called “Passwords Don’t Have to Suck”

### Quiet journaling station – *"I need to think for a bit"*

* Standard Notes, Joplin, or plain notebooks
* Guided prompts (e.g. “What surprised me?” / “I want to remember this later”)
* Pens, stickers, washi tape, and privacy

Option: Zip up a copy of your notes for later, encrypted

### Stealth & privacy tips – *"How do I browse without leaving footprints?"*

* Try DuckDuckGo, Tor Browser, Firefox Focus
* Learn about incognito modes (and what they don’t hide)
* Burner accounts and secret inboxes—how they work, when they help

Optional: Take home a "private browsing kit" USB

### Quiet support nook – *"Can I talk to someone about this thing?"*

* One-on-one chats with tech ally or support staff
* No pressure, no notes unless requested
* Just human-to-human support

Bring questions or fears—no tech expertise needed

### Creative space – *"I don’t want tech, I want colour"*

* Draw your phone’s “inner life”
* Create a comic about “The Day I Took My Account Back”
* Make collages out of old device manuals and privacy policies

Art can go home or stay anonymous on the “Power Wall”

## Take-home goodies

* A USB kit with:
  * Secure journaling tools
  * Private browser
  * Zines and bookmarks
* Zine: “First Moves—Taking Tech Back”
* Contact sheet for digital support orgs
* Fun sticker: “App Detective” / “I Outsmarted a Tracking Cookie”
* Print-at-home badges available too, for shelters with printers

## Final party (16:30–17:00)

* Cake and music (or hot chocolate and silence—your pick)
* DIY badge station (“App Detective”, “Incognito Queen”)
  * Make badges
  * Reflect with staff or peers
  * Dance (or watch)
* USB giveaway table
* Optional group zine table: fold & take away what you liked today
* Quiet support space for last questions or follow-up planning

## Trauma-informed principles

* No one is asked to share their story
* No one is assumed to know tech—or not
* Survivors decide what “safe” means
* All helpers trained to support with compassion, not control
* Everything is optional. Nothing is pushed.
