### 1. Project title

PowerOn: A tech safety for survivors choose-your-own-pace-day or ... make (it) your own title.

---

### 2. Summary of the project

*PowerOn* is a one-day, trauma-aware, tech empowerment workshop designed for survivors of intimate partner abuse. The session creates a calm, supportive space where survivors can explore digital safety at their own pace—through hands-on activities, optional device support, and privacy-focused tools.

Participants learn how to detect covert surveillance (e.g. stalkerware or location tracking), secure their devices and accounts, and rebuild confidence with technology in a non-technical, empowering environment.

---

### 3. Purpose and objectives

The workshop aims to:

* Increase survivors’ digital safety awareness and confidence
* Detect and respond to covert digital abuse
* Restore control over phones, accounts, and personal information
* Create an environment where survivors can explore tech safely
* Offer practical tools and connections to long-term support

---

### 4. Target audience

The workshop is for survivors of domestic or intimate partner abuse. Participants are invited through a local shelter, support group, or referral. All participation is voluntary, and all activities are optional.

---

### 5. Activities

The full-day session includes:

* Phone and device check-up stations (e.g. Pirogue, guided walkthroughs)
* Privacy skill-building games (e.g. safe browsing, password demos)
* Creative reflection zones (zine-making, journaling, quiet corners)
* Roleplay activities to explore red flags and tech-based control
* Celebration & takeaway kits, including USBs with guides and secure tools

The atmosphere is relaxed, flexible, and survivor-led. Food, drinks, and calm breakout spaces are available throughout the day.
