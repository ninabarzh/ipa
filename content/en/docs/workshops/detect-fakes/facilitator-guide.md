## Timing prompts (for ~90 minute workshop)

| Time        | Segment                        | Key notes                                                                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00:00–00:10 | **Welcome & check-in**         | Set the tone: no wrong questions, no judgement. Ask: “What made you curious to join this?”                       |
| 00:10–00:25 | **What are deepfakes?**        | Use examples—real and fake. Keep it practical: focus on *what* people might see, not the tech internals.         |
| 00:25–00:45 | **Spot the fake exercise**     | Show clips or images. Have participants work in small groups. Encourage guessing—then discuss what gave it away. |
| 00:45–01:05 | **Make your own fakes**        | Show how it’s done on Windows and Linux. Emphasise: “If you can make it, others can too.”                        |
| 01:05–01:20 | **Risk scenarios & responses** | Lead group brainstorms on: “Where could this show up in your life or work?” Then: “What would you *do*?”         |
| 01:20–01:30 | **Takeaways & debrief**        | Wrap up with three key points, a group share (“One thing you’re taking away?”), and a warm sign-off.             |

## Phrasing options to keep tone safe

- “This isn’t about catching you out—it’s about building your radar.”
- “There’s no shame in being fooled. That’s the point of this tech.”
- “What you’re noticing—lighting, sound, micro-expressions—are all valid instincts.”
- “The goal is not paranoia. The goal is to slow down when it matters.”

## Myth-busting cues

| Myth                                      | What to say instead                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “I’ll never be fooled by this.”           | “We’re all susceptible—it’s about reducing risk, not pretending we’re immune.”              |
| “It’s all AI now, no one’s safe.”         | “Most scams still rely on *basic manipulation*, not deep tech. Stay calm, not cynical.”     |
| “Only techies can make fakes.”            | “Anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can pull this off. That’s why we’re here.” |
| “You need special tools to detect fakes.” | “Your own senses, plus a few checks (reverse image search, metadata tools), go a long way.” |

## Emotional safety reminders

- **Always check the room.** If someone looks distressed, offer a break or private chat.
- **Avoid traumatic scenarios.** Don’t use fakes involving violence or impersonation of someone’s family.
- **Emphasise agency.** “You’re not powerless. Knowing this puts you ahead of most people.”

## Messages to reinforce

- Deepfakes are not magic—they are tools.
- You do not need to panic, just pay attention.
- Confidence comes from practice, not perfection.
