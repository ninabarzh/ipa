The scenarios and ideas explored in this workshop do not just stay in the room — they can help make the Deepfake 
Defence Kit stronger for others. At the end of the session, we will ask if the group is comfortable sharing any of 
today’s tips, strategies, or wording. Nothing will be taken without everyone’s agreement, and any shared contributions 
will be anonymised. If even one person prefers not to share, we will respect that choice in full.

## Checklist card – How to spot a deepfake

**Trust your senses, but verify your source.**

**Gut check**

* Something feels off? Start asking questions
* “Would this person really say or send that?”

**Check the visuals**

* Lip sync mismatched? Jerky blinking?
* Lighting or shadows wrong for the setting?
* Earrings flicker, teeth blur, hair stays too perfect?

**Listen closely**

* Voice glitches, weird pacing, robotic tone?
* Emotion does not match the content?

**Interrogate the context**

* Does this video or voice message appear out of nowhere?
* Can you find the same clip from a trusted source?
* Was it sent in a hurry to get a reaction?

**Tools (optional)**

* InVID, FotoForensics, reverse image/video search
* Ask someone else — two brains are better than one

**Pause before you act**

* Do not forward emotionally charged media without checking
* Do not reply under pressure — especially to demands or threats

**If in doubt, flag it. No shame in checking.**

## Scenario cards

Each fits A6. Print four per page. Cut to size.

**Scenario 1 – “I saw your video…”**

A survivor receives a message from a cousin saying they saw a nude video of her circulating in WhatsApp groups. She has never made such a video.

* What do you ask her first?
* How do you verify if the video exists and is real or fake?
* How do you support her without panic?

**Scenario 2 – “The boss said to send the passwords”**

A shelter volunteer gets a late-night voice message supposedly from the director, asking for urgent access to all shared accounts before “audit day.” The voice sounds nearly right.

* What should the volunteer do next?
* How can you double-check authenticity calmly?
* What is your emergency plan for leadership impersonation?

**Scenario 3 – “She’s lying — I’ve got proof”**

An abuser posts a video online claiming the survivor “admitted” to fabricating the abuse. The video shows her face and voice — but says things she never said.

* What is the emotional impact on her?
* How would you investigate the video?
* What is your response strategy, if any?

**Scenario 4 – “Can you believe this?”**

A volunteer forwards a shocking video of a public figure “confessing” to a crime, saying “Looks real, but what do you think?” You suspect a deepfake.

* How do you react and stay calm?
* What steps could help verify the video?
* How do you talk about it with your team?

## Takeaway sheet – Defending against deepfakes and digital lies

**What is a deepfake?**

Synthetic media — video, audio, or images — that look or sound real, but have been altered or entirely generated to deceive. Abusers use them to humiliate, control, or discredit.

**Where they appear**

* Fake confessions or fake nudes
* Impersonated messages from staff or survivors
* Edited or generated media to stir conflict
* Audio calls mimicking trusted voices

**How to defend yourself**

You do not need tech skills. You need:

* Awareness of manipulation tactics
* Calm thinking under pressure
* Clear team communication
* Trust and emotional support

**Quick response guide**

1. Stay calm. Reacting fast is what the hoaxer wants
2. Pause. Use your checklist, a colleague, or a tool
3. Document everything. Screenshots, links, dates
4. Support the affected person. Listen first
5. Be cautious about public response
6. Escalate using your internal plan or trusted advisors

**What helps most**

* Scenario-based practice
* A known team contact for strange messages
* Simple daily verification habits
* Speaking openly about strange experiences

**Final thought**

* Most deepfakes work through panic, not perfection.
* Your strength is not tech. It is teamwork and clear thinking.
