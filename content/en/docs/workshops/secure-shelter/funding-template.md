description: "A ready-to-adapt funding template for organising a Secure the Shelter Build-a-thon—a practical, staff-focused day to deploy your own private tech safety lab using Pirogue and Wazuh. It’s pitched for local authorities, foundations, or digital rights grant schemes, with plain-language explanations and a focus on empowerment and survivor safety."

### 1. Project Title

"Secure the shelter build-a-thon", "Building a Tech Safety Lab", or another creative title fitting your context.

### 2. Summary

We are organising a one or two-day hands-on *build-a-thon* where shelter staff will set up and test a dedicated digital safety lab. Using open-source tools like Wazuh (a security monitoring platform) and Pirogue (a network threat detector), the session will result in a fully functioning system to detect spyware, monitor risks, and safely support survivors experiencing tech-based abuse.

This is not a training or a lecture—it’s a collaborative, team-powered day or days that end with a working solution we can use in-house.

### 3. Objectives

* Equip shelter staff with their own private tech safety monitoring system
* Improve internal capacity to detect and respond to digital threats
* Build in-house skills and confidence in digital security
* Create a safe, non-judgemental environment to explore technology
* Reduce reliance on external (often expensive or unavailable) tech experts

### 4. Who is it designed for

The primary participants are shelter staff (e.g. frontline workers, intake coordinators, support staff). The build-a-thon supports their work with survivors by making digital threat detection more accessible, direct, and private.

### 5. Activities

* 10:00 – Setup & Introductions
  Coffee, gear unpacking, fun safety badge stickers

* 10:30 – Wazuh Lab Build
  Staff install and configure a private SIEM (security info & event manager) system on a mini server

* 13:00 – Lunch break
  With digital threat bingo and tool Q\&A

* 14:00 – Pirogue Setup
  Building and testing a Raspberry Pi-based detection tool to scan devices and check networks

* 15:30 – Integration & Testing
  Simulated attacks, roleplay checkups, alerts in action

* 16:30 – Celebration & Sharing
  Stickers, pictures, next steps, wrap-up

### 6. Budget breakdown

See [Secure the shelter build-a-thon: Cost estimate](/docs/workshops/secure-shelter/cost-guesstimate.md).

*We’re seeking funding to fully or partially cover these costs.*

### 7. Outcomes

* A working private digital safety system installed and maintained in-house
* A trained shelter team confident in spotting and responding to digital abuse
* Tools and workflows that can be reused for future staff or workshops
* Clear documentation and survivor-facing guides created during the day

### 8. Sustainability

All tools used (Wazuh, Pirogue) are open source and free to maintain. After the build-a-thon, staff will have access to reusable documentation, automated scripts, and a self-contained system with minimal ongoing cost. Technical allies and the PowerOn community are available for support.

### 9. Why it matters

Digital abuse is a daily reality for many survivors—but shelters are rarely given the tools to help. This project flips the script. Instead of outsourcing or relying on vague “cybersecurity advice,” this hands-on day gives staff their own tools, on their own terms. It's practical, empowering, and built for real-world mess.
