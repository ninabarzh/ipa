PiRogue is optional but useful in both cases for scanning phones privately without needing internet access.

### Option B: Cloud-based lab build-a-thon

*Includes secure remote logging, mobile support, and ongoing monitoring.*

[Estimated costs cloud solution included](/docs/lab/costs-cloud.md). 

This build-a-thon-in-a-day works only if you employ or hire cloud-skilled staff, which brings more cost. We do our best to 
prepare this solution in a repo, but cloud requires sufficient staff for participating in setting it up and 
maintaining it later. And if you are a shelter wanting full privacy, no internet reliance, and better physical control 
over the system, then option A is the better [choice](/docs/lab/architectures.md) anyway.

## What you get

* A functioning SIEM lab server (Wazuh, Kibana, log monitoring)
* Pirogue kit installed and tested for device check-ups
* Staff trained in basic digital forensics, threat detection, and safe use
* Printable guides and follow-up resources for use with survivors
* A lively, team-based, *build-it-together* day that doesn't feel like training

## Cost-saving ideas

* Reuse existing hardware (old laptop/server instead of new box)
* Ask for donated Pi hardware from local tech groups
* Use volunteer or in-house tech allies as co-facilitators
* Shared catering with other in-house events
