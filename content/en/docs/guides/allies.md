Support doesn’t require being a tech genius—or a vigilante. Whether you’re the go-to “computer person” or someone simply trusted to listen, here’s how to offer meaningful help without crossing lines or setting off alarms.

## How to help someone secure their tech without taking over

Tech help can easily veer into tech control. Here’s how to avoid that while still being useful.

1. Do: ask before acting. Start with something simple like:

* “Would you like help with this now, or should we make a plan for later?”
* Always check how much the person wants to know, do, or delegate.

2. Do: explain things step by step. Even if you could fix it in 2 minutes, talk them through what you’re doing and why. Knowledge is power—they may need to do it again later, alone.

3. Do: normalise their concerns. What might sound far-fetched to you could be exactly what’s happening. Say:

* “That’s absolutely something we can check for.”
* Not: “That seems a bit paranoid.”

4. Do: document what you’ve done. Make a private note (on paper or secure app) of what changes were made—especially passwords, resets, and device changes. The survivor should have a copy.

5. 🚫 Don’t: use your own email or phone number. No matter how temporary it seems. This creates dependency and may complicate legal or account recovery later.

6. 🚫 Don’t: log in with your own accounts. Using your own Apple ID, Google login, or app store credentials can leave digital fingerprints and introduce more confusion.

7. 🚫 Don’t: speak for them. Avoid saying “I’ll just do it.” It might seem efficient, but it removes agency. Let them lead, even if that means slowing down.

## How to talk to the police or courts about digital abuse

Unfortunately, not all frontline workers understand tech-based abuse. Here's how to make your words—and the survivor’s experience—count.

1. Focus on behaviour and intent, not just “technology”. Instead of saying:

* “They hacked her phone.”
* Try: “They installed an app that lets them see her messages and location in real time.”

Instead of:

* “Her thermostat’s acting weird.”
* Say: “The temperature keeps changing remotely, likely controlled via an app she doesn’t have access to.”

2. Use legal-adjacent language. Frame tech abuse in familiar legal terms like:

* Coercive control
* Harassment
* Surveillance without consent
* Unauthorised access to personal communications

These often map to existing laws more readily than “my smart speaker is acting up.”

3. Bring evidence that looks familiar

* Screenshots with timestamps
* Device access logs
* Email notifications of logins or password changes
* Written timeline of events

Even if digital forensics isn’t available, a simple chronology can help clarify.

4. Set expectations: keep it boring, accurate, repeatable. You’re not there to wow them with technical wizardry. Keep the story simple and consistent. Avoid speculative language.

* “Here’s what we know happened.”
* “Here’s what we found.”
* “Here’s what she did to stop it.”

5. 🚫 Don’t assume they’ll “get it”. Many police and court staff are undertrained in tech. If they look confused, pause and ask if they'd like clarification or examples.

6. 🚫 Don’t rely on jargon. Avoid terms like “man-in-the-middle attack” or “rootkit” unless you’re explaining it clearly. Instead, say:

* “He was intercepting data over their shared Wi-Fi.”
* “There’s software installed that runs invisibly and records everything.”
