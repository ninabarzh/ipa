## How to create a backup communications plan

1. Choose one or two trusted contacts. Not everyone needs to know your backup plan. One or two trusted people is enough. Ideally, they:

* Use secure communication tools
* Understand not to overshare
* Willn’t panic and announce plans in a family WhatsApp group

2. Pick a fallback contact method. Options include:

* A separate phone number (e.g. second SIM, work phone, basic mobile)
* A private email account known only to them
* An encrypted chat app (see below) on a clean device

3. Agree on check-ins or codewords (if needed). You could say:

* “I’m okay” means just that.
* “Can you send the book?” means you’re not safe.
  Avoid dramatic signals. Keep it ordinary.

4. Store their details offline. Write them down somewhere safe. Keep a small emergency contact card in your wallet, or store it in a secure notes app.

5. Have an alternate access location. If your devices are wiped or gone, how would you log in to anything?

* Use a secure password manager (Bitwarden, Proton Pass) with a memorised master password
* Keep backup codes printed and hidden, or encrypted in a trusted location

## How to set up a secondary device or SIM for emergencies

Sometimes the main phone isn't safe. A quiet backup can be the difference between isolation and connection.

1. Choose a simple device. A basic smartphone, or even a classic “dumb” phone, works. Buy it outright, used is fine, so long as you factory reset it yourself.

2. Register it with new credentials. Use a fresh email account and password. Don’t log into old cloud accounts unless you’re confident they’re clean.

3. Install only what’s necessary

* Signal or Element for messaging
* ProtonMail or Tutanota for email
* VPN, if possible
* Notes app (e.g. Standard Notes or Joplin)
  Skip social media or cloud syncing entirely.

4. Get a prepaid SIM (if needed). In some countries, SIMs can be bought without ID. If not, consider using Wi-Fi only and keeping the phone offline unless needed.

5. Store it securely. Keep it off and hidden. Charge occasionally. Turn it on in safe locations only. This is your silent escape hatch, not a daily driver.
