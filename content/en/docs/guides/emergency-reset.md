## How to prepare for a full digital reset

Sometimes, things are too tangled to untangle. When accounts are compromised, devices are suspect, or access is unsafe, a clean slate may be the most empowering option. Here's how to plan for a quiet, controlled digital reset—no dramatic button-pushing required.

1. Take stock: what do you want to keep? Before wiping anything, calmly gather the essentials:

* Contacts (exported, not synced)
* Photos, important documents, recordings
* Evidence (screenshots, logs, suspicious app details)
* Login details for accounts *you* created

2. Use safe storage. Back up only to locations you control:

* Encrypted USB stick
* Privacy-first cloud storage (Proton Drive, Sync.com)
  Avoid Google Drive or iCloud if they’re shared or monitored.

3. Separate personal from shared. Don’t bring old baggage with you. Create a list of accounts worth reclaiming—and another of those best abandoned.

4. Consider a new device. If you suspect your current phone or laptop is compromised, it’s safer to start fresh. A basic device, set up from scratch, gives you control. Borrowed or refurbished is fine—so long as *you* do the setup.

5. Factory reset, one device at a time. When ready:

* Wipe the device (factory reset)
* Reinstall only trusted apps
* Set up fresh accounts with unique passwords and app-based 2FA
  Avoid using backup restores—they bring old problems with them.

6. Stay quiet during the process. Don’t announce you’re “starting over.” Just... start. Slowly. Quietly. Prioritise safety over speed. It’s a transition, not a grand gesture.

## How to use a secure notes app for journaling or documentation

Journaling is powerful. It can help process thoughts, spot patterns, and gather evidence. But only if done safely. Let’s choose tools that don’t scream “I’m logging abuse!” when opened.

1. Pick a secure, discreet app. Good options include:

* [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com) – encrypted, simple interface, available on all devices
* [Tella](https://tella-app.org) – designed for sensitive environments, with a panic password
* [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org) – open source, markdown-friendly, and syncs via encrypted storage

2. Use a low-profile app name (if customisable). Some apps let you rename them. “Grocery List” attracts less attention than “Survivor Logbook”.

3. Set a passcode or use fingerprint lock. Turn on biometric or PIN protection. Avoid face unlock if your device is shared.

4. Store entries offline or sync securely. Avoid syncing to shared cloud accounts.

* If syncing, use Proton Drive, encrypted WebDAV, or similar
* Tella allows local-only storage with emergency deletion options

5. Include context, but stay neutral in language. If you’re journaling with the goal of possible legal use, keep entries factual: dates, actions, and direct quotes when possible.

6. Regularly export and back up (privately). Create regular backups to a secure device or USB stick, and store them in a safe place—ideally offsite.

## How to access support sites and guides without leaving a trace

Sometimes, the first steps to safety start with reading. But if someone checks your device or browser, you don’t want them seeing where you’ve been. Here’s how to browse without footprints.

1. Use incognito or private browsing mode

* Chrome/Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + N` (or `Cmd + Shift + N` on Mac)
* Safari: Tap Tabs → Private

Private mode won’t save your history, cookies, or site data—but doesn’t hide your activity from Wi-Fi or router logs.

2. Use a privacy-focused browser

* DuckDuckGo Browser: Blocks trackers, hides searches, has a “fire” button to wipe everything instantly
* Brave: More robust than incognito alone, blocks ads and third-party trackers
* Tor Browser: Best for anonymity, routes traffic through multiple relays. Slower, but extremely private

3. Search privately. Use DuckDuckGo or Startpage instead of Google. They don’t log or personalise your searches.

4. Clear browser history manually (if needed). If you forgot private mode:

* Open browser settings → History
* Delete individual entries or clear by time range
  Target only the relevant items if you want to avoid raising flags.

5. Avoid saving passwords or autofill. Make sure your browser isn’t logging in automatically or saving form data. Check under Settings → Privacy & Security.

6. Be aware of screenshots and notifications. Some phones keep previews of visited pages or show notifications from websites. Turn off previews and clean your notification tray if using shared devices.
