## How to check a phone for stalkerware or suspicious apps

If your phone feels like it has a second pair of eyes, you might be right. It’s not paranoia if someone installed something when you weren’t looking. Let’s go through the calm way to check, without making noise.

1. Subtle signs something’s wrong

* Battery draining quickly for no good reason
* Strange behaviour (screen flashing, overheating, sluggishness)
* Apps you don’t remember installing
* Unexplained data use, especially if mobile data is off

None of these alone prove anything, but together? Worth a closer look.

2. Browse your app list manually. Open your list of installed apps. Scroll slowly. Look for:

* Apps with generic names (e.g. “System Service”, “Device Info”)
* No icon or odd icon
* Very small file sizes (spyware often hides in plain sight)

3. Check permissions. You’re looking for apps with access they shouldn’t need:

* Android: **Settings → Privacy → Permission manager**
* iPhone: **Settings → Privacy & Security → check Camera, Microphone, Location**

If a calculator app has access to your microphone, that’s a red flag.

4. Review device admin apps (Android only). These have extra control. **Settings → Security → Device admin apps**

Anything you don’t recognise? Flag it, but don’t remove it yet.

5. Avoid uninstalling immediately. Uninstalling spyware might alert the person who put it there. Instead:

* Note down suspicious app names
* Take screenshots or photos of settings
* Plan a full reset or seek help before taking action

6. Consider a secondary device. A basic phone (even a “dumb” one) can give you safe space for sensitive conversations while you assess the main one.

## How to do a clean start with a new device

Sometimes, it’s best not to fight the old ghosts. If your device feels too compromised, starting fresh gives you the freedom to rebuild.

1. Choose a device you control from setup. Avoid anything gifted, refurbished without warranty, or set up by someone else “to help”. New isn’t always essential, just clean, updated, and under your full control.

2. Don’t restore from cloud backups. Tempting as it is to press “restore”, this may bring problems. Set up as new.

* Manually copy essential data (photos, contacts, etc.)
* Leave behind old apps, settings, and stored passwords

3. Install minimal apps. Stick to essentials, messages, email, maps. Avoid logging into old accounts until you’re sure they’re secure.

4. Use new credentials where possible

* New email address
* Fresh app accounts
* Don’t reuse old usernames or passwords, they may be known

5. Delay syncing across devices. Until you’re confident your new setup is safe, keep your devices independent. Avoid signing in to shared laptops or syncing messages across platforms.

6. Hide in plain sight (if needed). If you're in a situation where the change might raise questions, you can set up the phone with a “public” profile and keep sensitive apps and accounts hidden using secure folders or multiple user modes (Android supports this).

## How to reduce tracking on your phone

Even if there’s no obvious spyware, most modern phones leak more information than you’d like. Here’s how to politely tell your phone to stop tattling.

1. Turn off location services (selectively)

* iPhone: **Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services**
* Android: **Settings → Location → App location permissions**

Rather than switch it off completely, limit access to apps that truly need it (like maps). Set others to “While using the app” or “Deny”.

2. Check which apps run in the background. Some apps quietly wake up, sip your battery, and log your every move.

* Android: Settings → Apps → Battery → Unrestricted apps
* iPhone: Settings → General → Background App Refresh

Disable for anything that doesn’t need it. Most social apps don’t.

3. Review app permissions regularly. Apps may ask for more than they need. Check for access to:

* Microphone
* Camera
* Contacts
* SMS
* Calendar

If you don’t remember saying yes, feel free to say no.

4. Reset ad ID and turn off personalisation

* Android: **Settings → Privacy → Ads → Reset advertising ID**
* iPhone: **Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising → Turn off Personalised Ads**

Doesn’t stop everything, but cuts down on targeted tracking.

5. Watch for battery use clues. If an unknown app is gobbling power in the background, that’s worth investigating.

* **Settings → Battery → View by app**

If something obscure is high on the list, dig deeper.

6. Use Airplane Mode when not in use. It sounds obvious, but toggling Airplane Mode when your phone’s idle cuts off most trackers. Especially useful at night, or during high-stress periods.

## How to safely back up a device before resetting

If you’re planning a factory reset, or a clean-slate start, it’s vital to think about what to keep. Some data is irreplaceable. Other data might help prove what happened later.

1. Decide what to keep

* Photos and videos
* Contacts and calendars
* Important messages
* Evidence: screenshots, chat logs, suspicious apps

2. Use external, private storage. Back up to somewhere not connected to your current cloud accounts (avoid Google Drive or iCloud if those accounts may still be monitored):

* Encrypted USB stick
* Private cloud (e.g. Proton Drive, Sync.com)
* SD card (Android only)

3. Don’t back up everything. Avoid bulk “device image” backups that bring along compromised apps or malware. Manually export just what you need.

4. Export messages or logs as PDFs or text. Apps like Signal and WhatsApp let you export chats. Do this before uninstalling the app or wiping the phone. Save the files somewhere safe.

5. Take screenshots of app permissions and device settings. Especially if you suspect spyware. Even if you’re not ready to act now, this could be helpful later.

6. Store evidence copies securely. Make two copies: one for immediate use, one locked away. If needed, ask a trusted person to hold onto a copy, or use secure cloud storage with two-factor authentication.
