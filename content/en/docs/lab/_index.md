These labs are designed for people working on the front lines of support. That includes shelters and safe houses 
helping clients stay digitally safe, legal aid workers building cases, and technically minded advocates offering 
digital support. It can also be used by survivors directly on an extra PC.

The SIEM Stack helps uncover signs of digital surveillance—whether that’s stalkerware, remote access, or hidden 
tracking tools. It can show if someone is accessing a device without permission, support safe evidence collection 
if needed, and guide survivors through steps to secure their tech. 

The systems are built to be privacy-respecting from the ground up, with all logs encrypted and anonymised to meet 
data protection laws.

It uses open-source tools originally built for cybersecurity teams, and adapts it for survivor support. You don’t 
need to be a tech expert. The systems come with setup scripts, checklists, and guides for identifying threats and 
responding safely. It is designed for real-world use—including in places without big budgets or in-house IT teams.

These SIEM stacks are currently under active development. That means things may change rapidly—features may shift, 
integrations may break, and some configurations are still experimental or untested in production environments. We 
are actively expanding documentation, adding sample configurations, and refining log correlation strategies across 
Zeek, Suricata, Sysmon, and Linux endpoints. Contributions, corrections, and field-tested improvements are most 
welcome.
