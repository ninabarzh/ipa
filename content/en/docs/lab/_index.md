This lab is designed for people working on the front lines of support. That includes shelters and safe houses helping clients stay digitally safe, legal aid workers building cases, and technically minded advocates offering digital support. It can also be used by survivors directly—if they have access to someone who can help with the technical setup.

The SIEM Stack helps uncover signs of digital surveillance—whether that’s stalkerware, remote access, or hidden tracking tools. It can show if someone is accessing a device without permission, support safe evidence collection if needed, and guide survivors through steps to secure their tech. The system is built to be privacy-respecting from the ground up, with all logs encrypted and anonymised to meet data protection laws.

It uses a trusted open-source tool called [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/), originally built for cybersecurity teams, and adapts it for survivor support. You don’t need to be a tech expert. The system comes with setup scripts, checklists, and guides for identifying threats and responding safely. It is designed for real-world use—including in places without big budgets or in-house IT teams.
